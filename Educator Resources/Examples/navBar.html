			<p>Vault-Tec Bobbleheads are collectible items in Fallout 4. They&#39;re figurines representing Vault-Boy in different poses and outfits. Each one you collect will increase a SPECIAL stat or upgrade a perk. Collecting 10 of them will unlock the They&#39;re Not Dolls… achievement, while collecting 20 will give you the …They&#39;re Action Figures trophy. This guide will show you all bobblehead locations in Fallout 4. </p>
			<p>After you leave the starting Vault, you’ll have to go to the Sole Survivor&#39;s house in Sanctuary Hills. Go into the corridor on the left and into the baby’s room (last door on the right). You’ll find a You’re SPECIAL skill book on the floor there. It will let you put 1 point into a stat of your choice.
			   Bonus: +1 on any SPECIAL stat.</p>
